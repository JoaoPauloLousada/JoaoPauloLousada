I am an experienced front-end developer and Node.js certified, working with the latest technologies to get the best results for web and mobile systems. I have been working for seven years as a web developer, developing projects for different branches, from companies from the health insurance market to companies in the financial market. Working with modern and efficient technologies, always worrying about delivering the best result to the customer, meeting the requirements of the project and implementing them with a focus on excellence. I'm experienced in Javascript, which I use often to build modern web systems, REST and GraphQL APIs and mobile applications. I am a super fast learner, learning anything I need to in order to complete the projects in which I work.
Here are a few technologies Iâ€™ve been working with recently:
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Vue.js
- Typescript
- Angular
- Node.js
